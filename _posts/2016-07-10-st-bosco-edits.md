  Hi! I'm Bethany, and I get excited about grammar. As a student in a
  world-class editing program and lover of words, I look up to St. Bosco, a
  socially active Italian priest recognized for his extraordinary skills in
  writing and editing. His legacy continues today as I empower authors,
  businesses and bloggers to share their stories with the world.
