**Welcome to St. Bosco Edits**

Hi! I'm Bethany, and I get excited about grammar. As a student in a world-class editing program and lover of words, I look up to St. Bosco, a socially active Italian priest recognized for his extraordinary skills in writing and editing. His legacy continues today as I empower authors, businesses and bloggers to share their stories with the world.
